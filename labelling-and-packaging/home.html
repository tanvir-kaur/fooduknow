                        Whenever you are purchasing any package food, you will notice that % Daily value (DV) or % Recommended Dietary Allowances
                        (RDA) are mentioned on the label. Have you ever thought how significant it is and what does it mean?
                        Here, we will provide a brief insight on this.
                    </p>
                    <p >
                        For example, amount of sodium (280 mg) is mentioned on the label, but is it really relevant to you? No,
                        but the % DV of sodium (12%) provides the requirement of sodium in one serving; so that you can consume
                        that food product according to your diet. </p>

                        <i> What is a food label?</i> It is a means to advertise the product quality, to target specific
                        consumer and to make brand value. A label of packaged food is the only way of communication between
                        Food business operators (FBO) and consumers. FSSAI, the apex food regulatory body of India provides
                        certain guidelines regarding packaging and labelling.
                    </p>
                    <p>Complete information has to be displayed on principal display panel (it include all visible side of package)
                        in legitimate form.FBOs have to mention following information of the food products on the label (<i>deviating from these regulations leads to misbranding the product resulting in penalty </i>):</p>

                        Have you ever wondered why some apples are more shine in appearance than others? Are they really fresh apples? Is it wax
                        coating on Apples? Is it safe to use these types of Apples? And continue. Yes, these shining on apples
                        are due to wax coating over it. Apples produce wax coating over it naturally but 50% of it depleted
                        during handling, transportation etc. Hence, Producer wraps up it with other wax coating separately.
