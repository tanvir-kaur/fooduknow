                    <p>
                        Whenever you are purchasing any package food, you will notice that % Daily value (DV) or % Recommended Dietary Allowances
                        (RDA) are mentioned on the label. Have you ever thought how significant it is and what does it mean?
                        Here, we will provide a brief insight on this.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, amount of sodium (280 mg) is mentioned on the label, but is it really relevant to you? No,
                        but the % DV of sodium (12%) provides the requirement of sodium in one serving; so that you can consume
                        that food product according to your diet.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 mt-20">
                    <p>Still confused? Let me drive into some technical information. Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) or
                        Reference Daily intake (RDI) is the average daily dietary nutrient intake level that meets the requirement
                        of healthy individuals. RDA is determined based on multiple factors like age group, gender, and physiological
                        status of individual and group. It has set by ICMR & NIN guidelines in India and it is mandatory
                        to mention %RDA on the label, in case of <i>health supplements, nutraceuticals, food for special dietary
                        uses and food for special medical purposes by FSSAI</i>, but not for normal food products in India.
                        On other hand, % DV is necessary to be mentioned on the label for all food products in U.S. and Canada
                        and is determined based on RDI or DRV (Daily reference value) and average diet of 2000 calorie. %
                        Daily value or %RDA is calculated based on the ratio of amount of nutrient in a serving of food and
                        RDA or DV of that nutrient. For example, assume that amount of Calcium in Food is 300 mg per serving
                        and RDA of Calcium is 600 mg/day (as per ICMR), then %DV of calcium would be 50% and you have to
                        take 2 servings of the product to meet 100% daily value of calcium in a day.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <p>So, now you might have thought that is this necessary to aim for 100% DV for all nutrients? It all depend
                        on nutrients and thatâ€™s why FDA categorized them into 3 categories: </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
                        <li><b>Nutrient to encourage:</b>include Dietary fiber, Vitamin D, Calcium, Potassium, Iron (mandatory
                            to mention) and other also like Vitamin A and C (voluntarily basis) and these nutrients are encourage
                            to aim for more than 100% DV.</li>
                        <li><b>Nutrient  to  limit: </b> include total fat, saturated fat, trans-fat, cholesterol, and sodium
                            and 100% DV is limit to consume these nutrients as it may cause other effects if consume more.</li>
                        <li><b>Nutrient  without  comment:</b> include total carbohydrate, sugar and protein and these not regarded
                            as health concern except added sugar.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <p>Sometime, you will find nutrients with more than 100% DV on label and it is due to presence of various
                        RDI or RDA set by different authorities (FDA, Health Canada, ICMR etc).
                    </p>
                    <p>So, next time when you purchase any food pre-package foods, just go through the nutritional panel to
                        know how healthy it is for you.</p>
