                        Have you ever wondered why some apples are more shine in appearance than others? Are they really fresh apples? Is it wax
                        coating on Apples? Is it safe to use these types of Apples? And continue. Yes, these shining on apples
                        are due to wax coating over it. Apples produce wax coating over it naturally but 50% of it depleted
                        during handling, transportation etc. Hence, Producer wraps up it with other wax coating separately.
                        So let’s face the truth and facts about edible coatings here.

                        These type of thin layer coatings made of edible material that applied to surface of food product to provide a barrier to
                        oxygen, moisture, or in short, you can say to extend the shelf life of product are known as edible
                        coatings. Following are the distinct features that make edible coatings different from any other
                        synthetic wrapper or packaging:-

                    <p>Edible coatings can be wrapping up on food items by several methods like brushing, spraying, dipping
                        and panning followed by drying. But are really they made up of edible materials or with synthetic
                        polyfilm? Yes, it constitute of basic biomolecules such as Lipids, Carbohydrates and Proteins with
                        distinct functionality of it as –

                    <ul style="list-style:circle">
                        <li>Carbohydrates: It act as good oxygen barrier and create the anaerobic environment inside food which
                            increase the shelf life of product but it is more susceptible for moisture due to its hydrophilic
                            nature. Examples: Chitosan, Alginates, Carrageenans, Cellulose, Starch and its derivatives. </li>
                        <li>Proteins: Provide mechanical strength due to its polymerization of amino acids but prone to moisture
                            absorption due to hydrophilic nature. Examples: Gelatin, Corn Zein, Soy Protein, Casein, Keratin,
                            Wheat Gluten, Casein, Collagen, Whey.</li>
                        <li>Lipids: Good barrier to moisture due to its hydrophobic nature but brittle in strength. Examples:
                            Wax and oil based coatings (Animal wax – Bees wax, shellac, spermaceti wax; Vegetable wax –Carnauba
                            wax, Bayberry wax,, palm wax; Mineral and synthetic wax- Paraffin wax, microcrystalline wax),
                            fatty acids, Resins, Emulsions.</li>

                    <p>As we have seen, not an individual molecule is effective to form edible coatings. Hence, composite or
                        bilayer edible coatings is most preferable in which could be combinations of any 2-3 biomolecules.
                        Edible coatings are also available on commercialized French fries, cheese strips, fruits and vegetables
                        etc. </p>
                    <p>
                        People generally think that these edible coatings are not safe but it’s not the case. Regulatory authorities USFDA and FSSAI
                        allowed wax coatings over fruits and consider it as safe.
