                        Air frying is one such new technology that uses superheated air for cooking at a high temperature of 200º C. It forms a crispy
                        outer layer and a moist inner layer. The food tastes similar to a deep fried product due to the maillard
                        reaction effect.

                    </p>
                    <p> Now let us tell you something about acrylamide. It is known to be a cancer causing agent and is formed
                        when food products are exposed to high levels of heat. It is mostly commonly formed in deep fried
                        <foods class=""></foods>
                    </p>
                    <p class="hidden-article-section" id="div-oil-less-fry">
                        But it has also been shown through experimentation that acrylamide formation in case of air frying is much lower than in
                        deep oil frying.
                        </br>
                        Indulge in the taste of deep fried potato chips with the same taste, but lesser calories. Who would not like to consume such
                        a product along with maintaining good health? So give it try and forget the traditional deep fried
                        process of cooking, and go for the new air frying alternative. Reference:

                <h3>The Quick Freezing </h3>
                <h4>April 22,2017</h4>
                <div class="col-sm-6 img-responsive">

                        Freezing as a food preservation process gained importance as it slows down metabolic processes like enzymatic activities
                        in food products and also microbial growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For long term storage and preserving the aesthetics and nutritional value of the product, freezing has to be proper. Two
                        types of freezing processes are prevalent: slow and fast freezing. Difference between these two is:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The size of ice crystals formed in both the cases. Larger ice crystals are formed in case of slow freezing, which damages
                        the cell walls of food materials. On the other hand, smaller ice crystals are formed in case of quick
                        freezing, without much effect on cell walls. Hence, fast freezing is preferred.
                    </p>

                            Individual Quick Freezing (IOF) is a type of fast freezing process. In this process, food products are frozen quickly as
                            individual particles, hence the quality of the product is maintained. Peas and corns are generally
                            frozen by this method.

                <h3>Good about "Irradiating Foods"</h3>
                <h4>April 22,2017</h4>
                <div class="col-sm-6 img-responsive">
                    <img src="../img/cake.jpg" width="80%" height="70%" />

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>
                        It’s a common perception that radiations are always harmful, may it be from sun or from any radioactive metals. These radiations
                        are harmful for our skin and should definitely be avoided. On the other hand, these radiations can
                        be put to some good use by irradiating food materials as it kills the harmful microorganisms. And
                        no harmful products remain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this process, the food is passed through the irradiation field, so the food itself never becomes radioactive, and it completely
                        safe to consume. Contamination might occur only if it comes in contact with the radioactive metal,
                        which won’t be the case as the facility is made completely safe.
                    </p>
                    <div class="hidden-article-section" id="div-irradiating-food">
                        <p>
                            Also, this is a low temperature technology, doesn’t raise the temperature of the food product. Also, the appearance and taste
                            of the food product remains the same. The unit for measuring the dose of radiation is "Gray".
                            A dosage of 2-7 kGy is generally sufficient to eliminate pathogenic organisms from a food product.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are many advantages of using this technology. Spices are usually preserved using this process. The preservation of
                            wine from unwanted bacterial that could spoil the wine, can also be done using this technology,
                            but this isn’t done commercially, and still in the trial stage of research.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hence, it is very important to change our perspective and adapt ourselves with the latest technologies emerging in the world,
                            because such technologies would only be successful, if we, the consumers, start using such products.
