                        An average sugar-sweetened soda bottle has approximately 150 calories, and the diet version of it has 0 calories. But ever
                        wondered, by saving on these 150 calories, what negative health impact it could have on the body??
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yes that’s true. Market these days is flooded with zero or low calorie food products. These are made using sugar substitutes,
                        also known as non-nutritive sweeteners, like, aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, sugar alcohols, etc.
                        The claims regarding the health effects of these sweeteners are quite confusing, as some saying these
                        to be helpful, while other declaring these to be harmful for the body. </p>
                    <div class="hidden-article-section" id="div-artificial-sweetner">
                        <p>
                            Recent studies show that these could potentially be harmful for the body and could further lead to several other health problems,
                            including:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="list-style:square">
                            <li>excessive weight gain</li>
                            <li>metabolic syndrome </li>
                            <li>diabetes </li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Although, stevia, has recently been used commercially, is a natural sweetener and is derived from a plant. As far as safety
                            aspects are concerned, no negative effects related to the consumption of stevia have been reported
                            so far.
                        </p>
                        <p> So next time you sip in a diet drink or consume a diet food product, do keep in mind the potential
                            health hazards these products could cause. Stay healthy, stay fit !!

                <h3>Brown Rice: The Healthier Version </h3>
                <h4>April 22,2017</h4>

                    <p>
                        It is an old saying that All that glitters is not gold, and goes aptly with the rice. The shiny appearance of white rice
                        could be deceiving. On the other hand, not so good looking brown rice is more nutritious. Most of
                        the time we go by the looks. But in case of rice, don’t get deceived by the shiny appearance. The
                        polished rice is shiny, and is less nutritious than the brown rice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The difference between the two types of rice is the different processing techniques. The crude form of rice is brown, in
                        which just the outer layer of hull is being removed. Brown rice is further processed or milled into
                        white rice by removing its outer coating of bran. This process, not just removes the coat, but also
                        the nutrients contained in the coat, including thiamine, magnesium, potassium and magnesium.
                    </p>
                    <p class="hidden-article-section" id="div-brown-rice">
                        Hence, white rice is devoid of these vitamins and minerals, which are present in brown rice. Thiamine, the vitamin present
                        in rice is destroyed during milling and polishing of brown rice to white rice. Moreover, brown rice
                        is considered as a low glycemic index food product, hence it reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes.
                        </br>
                        So why not give it a try and switch to consuming the healthier version of rice.

                        The market these days is flowing with food products comprising probiotics, the healthy bacteria, which impart health benefits
                        to the consumers. Probiotics are live microorganisms can be ingested, thus improving the gut flora
                        of the host. These mainly comprises organisms of genera, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. The major
                        advantage of consuming them is: improving host’s immune system, better calcium absorption, alleviating
                        diarrhoeal symptoms, improving symptoms of lactose intolerance, better digestion and adding bulk
                        to the stool.

                            Various forms of probiotic food products available in the market are yogurt, fruit drinks, etc. Majorly consumed yogurt can
                            be made even more healthy option by the addition of fruit pulp to it. Probiotics are sensitive
                            to external environmental stresses, like high temperature and low pH. Hence, these are encapsulated
                            to increase their viability in the body of the host. Food grade polymers like, CMC, gelatin,
                            alginate are used for this purpose.

                            It is quite important to stay fit and healthy, so that we can enjoy life and eat whatever we want. One step towards this
                            would be improving the gut flora. Whenever we are on a course of antibiotics, which kill the
                            probiotics in the body, it is always recommended to consume probiotics after the course is complete,
                            to recover back the gut flora.
