			<h3>Ice-blocks will come under the purview of FSSAI</h3>
			<p>Do you think that pure sugarcane juice with some ice-cubes is safe to be consumed? No, because ice blocks or ice cubes
				are generally made up of contaminated water and come from factories that are just manufacturing ice for multipurpose
				use. This is the main reason you become sick after having pure juice with ice cubes, especially in summer season and
				sometimes it leads to waterborne diseases, such as Jaundice. </p>
			<p>Ice-cube is not only used for edible purpose, it is also used during preservation/transportation/storage and can come
				in contact with food products, but there are no regulations or safety parameters for the same. Hence, FSSAI regulates
				all types of ice-cubes or blocks which are used for preserving/transporting/storing of food products, and released order
				regarding same. </p>
			<p>According to FSSAI’s recent order dated on 27th April, 2017, Any ice/ice blocks used in preservation/ storage/transportation
				of food products or coming in contact with food products shall conform to the microbiological requirements prescribed
				for edible ice in Appendix B of the FSS (Food Products Standards & Additives) regulation, 2011.</p>
			<p>So next time when you drink juice from road side vendor, just avoid the ice cubes or else that might cost you even more.</p>

			<h3>Milk Adulteration in more in Northern States: FSSAI</h3>
			<p>Do you think milk from the vendors that deliver to your doorstep is safe to be consumed? Is it pure? Or most of the time,
				your mother told vendor Pani mat milaya karo (Please don’t mix water in milk) or you have watched the news on TV channels
				about synthetic milk.</p>
			<p>Yes, milk adulteration still exists in India, irrespective of organized or unorganized sectors. FSSAI told media that
				milk adulteration was low in southern states , more in northern states as per survey conducted by them. Sample size was
				around 2500 and some states showed no adulteration which is not even possible as felt by chairman Ashish Bahuguna personally
				during a press conference.</p>
			<p>But the question is how do we restrict it? FSSAI is also ready with a solution, and they have developed a test-kit to
				check quality of milk, but negotiation is still under process for its commercial mass production. </p>
