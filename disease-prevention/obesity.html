                        Todayâ€™s lifestyle is mostly dependent on machines, rather than physically doing even small tasks. Consumption of junk foods,
                        like Burger, Pizza, Samosa, Kachori etc. has become a routine. These factors lead to gain in weight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do you think, you are also a part of this lifestyle? Yes, most of the people are. The most common type of condition linked
                        to such a modern lifestyle is obesity, which further leads to health risks,such as type 2 diabetes,
                        cardiovascular disease, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, stroke, osteoarthritis,
                        some types of cancer.

                    <p>
                        So what could be the reason that leads to obesity? It is due to the energy imbalance, means consumption of calories in our
                        diet is more than calories consumed or burned. Most of the cases we come across today are related
                        to diet. Issues like wrong eating habits, high consumption of junk food, not enough physical activity
                        leads to gain in weight of an individual, and finally to obesity. But, in some cases it could be
                        related to the genes as well.

                        It is generally measured on the basis of BMI (Body Mass Index), which is basically ratio of body weight (in kg) to square
                        of height (in m). BMI and its interpretation for an adult of age 20 or older, is mentioned below:

                        So why not take a step today itself to lead a healthy life further ahead by making some changes in your daily routine as
                        well as in diet, such as:
                        <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                            <li>Lower or limit the consumption of high sugar food products, saturated & trans-fat, beer, and
                                deep fried foods like French fries.</li>
                            <li>Start to count calorie intake on daily basis</li>
                            <li>Start to consume a filling breakfast, eat less in dinner</li>
                            <li>Consume more of whole grains, fruits and veggies</li>
                            <li>Do take out time for some physical activity in your daily routine</li>
                            <li>Stop taking lots of medicines which also increase weight of body</li>
                        </ul>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even, the food industry could also play a part to fight against obesity in many ways, like reducing the fat, sugar and salt
                        content in processed foods, stopping promotion and marketing of high sugar products especially for
                        children, and providing nutritious and healthy choices to consumers at affordable price.
