                        Mothers are always worried about the health of their children and this is the reason, we have to hear this dialogue so often,
                        "don’t go out, it’s raining or else you will catch cold or fever". I think it’s true for almost everyone.
                        Some people get sick quite often, while others don’t. Do you know why?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is all because of the <b>immune system </b>, which varies from individual to individual. Immunity
                        is the power or ability of the body to fight the development of a disease, and if our immune system
                        is weak, we tend to fall sick quite often. Hence, building a strong immunity is first step towards
                        a healthy lifestyle.

                        Do you always feel uneasy and suffer from digestive symptoms after having milk and milk products? Have you ever got suggestions
                        from people around you like you might have a milk allergy? So lets know what this actually is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might think lactose intolerance is a type of milk allergy? No, that isnt correct. In milk allergy, immune response occurs
                        due to milk proteins, while lactose intolerance is a digestive disorder. People with milk allergy
                        cant even tolerate the minor level of milk proteins. On the other hand, lactose intolerants could
                        tolerate up to 12 g of lactose per day and also, dairy products like hard cheese which are processed,
                        henceforth containing less lactose as compared to milk.

                        Today’s lifestyle is mostly dependent on machines, rather than physically doing even small tasks. Consumption of junk foods,
                        like Burger, Pizza, Samosa, Kachori etc. has become a routine. These factors lead to gain in weight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do you think, you are also a part of this lifestyle? Yes, most of the people are. The most common type of condition linked
                        to such a modern lifestyle is obesity, which further leads to health risks,such as type 2 diabetes,
                        cardiovascular disease, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, stroke, osteoarthritis,
                        some types of cancer.
