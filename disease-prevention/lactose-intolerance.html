                        Do you always feel uneasy and suffer from digestive symptoms after having milk and milk products? Have you ever got suggestions
                        from people around you like you might have a milk allergy? So lets know what this actually is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might think lactose intolerance is a type of milk allergy? No, that isnt correct. In milk allergy, immune response occurs
                        due to milk proteins, while lactose intolerance is a digestive disorder. People with milk allergy
                        cant even tolerate the minor level of milk proteins. On the other hand, lactose intolerants could
                        tolerate up to 12 g of lactose per day and also, dairy products like hard cheese which are processed,
                        henceforth containing less lactose as compared to milk.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 mt-20">
                    <p>
                        Lactose is a sugar present in milk and our body cant absorb it as such through bloodstream. Hence, we have lactase enzyme
                        that digests lactose and converts it into absorbable form, like, glucose and galactose. But, deficiency
                        of this enzyme makes body unable to digest lactose, leading to a digestive disorder, known as lactose
                        intolerance. This deficiency of enzyme varies from individual to individual, so as tolerance level
                        of lactose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, the question arises how would you know whether you are lactose tolerant or not? So, whenever you are drinking milk and
                        milk products and come across the following symptoms after 30 minutes to 2 hours, you should consult
                        doctor and get it tested via Hydrogen breath test & Stool acidity test.
                    </p>

                            <li>Abdominal cramps & pain</li>
                            <li>Nausea </li>
                            <li>Bloating </li>
                            <li>Excessive flatulence (gas) </li>
                            <li>Stomach rumbling</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        Every lactose intolerant person needs to look for ways to avoid such digestive symptoms, as there is no cure to it. Here
                        are few of them-
                        <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                            <li>Avoid milk and milk products.</li>
                            <li>Avoid the products that may contain lactose such as salad dressing, sauces, processed breakfast
                                cereals, bakery products, soup, protein powders and bars, non-dairy whipping cream.</li>
                            <li>Use alternative milk like soy milk, rice milk, coconut milk, almond milk, hazelnut milk, oat
                                milk, peanut milk. </li>
                            <li>Sometimes you can also find medications, like lactase in tablet or drug form. </li>
                        </ul>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Avoiding of dairy product couldnt fulfill the need of calcium and vitamin D which is necessary for bones. Hence, it is recommended
                        to use products, such as Spinach, Sardines, Rhubarb, Soy milk, Broccoli, Orange, Tuna, Lettuce or
                        its supplementation in medication form, containing calcium or vitamin D.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next time, check the label while purchasing food product so that you can avoid it if you are lactose intolerant or even milk
                        allergy.
