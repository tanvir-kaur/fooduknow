                        Mothers are always worried about the health of their children and this is the reason, we have to hear this dialogue so often,
                        "don’t go out, it’s raining or else you will catch cold or fever". I think it’s true for almost everyone.
                        Some people get sick quite often, while others don’t. Do you know why?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is all because of the <b>immune system </b>, which varies from individual to individual. Immunity
                        is the power or ability of the body to fight the development of a disease, and if our immune system
                        is weak, we tend to fall sick quite often. Hence, building a strong immunity is first step towards
                        a healthy lifestyle.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 mt-20">
                    <p>
                        Immune system is like the army of our body, and the warriors (referred to as immune cells) need to be loaded with good food,
                        because their function is not just to restrict the entry of pathogens, but also to maintain body’s
                        safety. People generally use medicines and supplements to build immunity,but many categories of foods,
                        known as <b>immunity boosters</b>, keep us away from common flu and other
                        such seasonal diseases and increases our immunity, the natural way. A quick list of these foods is
                        as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ul style="list-style:square">
                            <li><b>Citrus fruits</b>–amla, lemon, etc. </li>
                            <li><b>Fruits</b>-blueberries and raspberries, papaya</li>
                            <li><b>Herbs</b>-ulsi, ginger, garlic, neem</li>
                            <li><b>Spices </b>-turmeric, black-pepper, coriander</li>
                            <li><b>Veggies </b>-green leafy</li>
                            <li><b>Tea </b>-green tea</li>
                            <li><b>Probiotics </b>-yogurt</li>
                            <li><b>Sunflower seeds or flax seeds</b></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But now, the question arises that why these foods are important? They provide us with antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and
                        phytonutrients that nourishes our immune system. The immunity declines with age, therefore, it is
                        important to maintain a healthy life by daily boosting our immune system.
                        Further, a few more changes in our daily lifestyle could also help us in building immunity. These include:
                        <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                            <li>Yoga & meditation </li>
                            <li>Limit alcohol intake</li>
                            <li>Get proper sleep</li>
                            <li>Not skipping breakfast </li>
                            <li>Don’t smoke</li>
                            <li>Proper exercise – a morning walk of 30 minutes</li>
                        </ul>

                    </p>
                    <p>So next time, when you are munching some snacks, then avoid samosa and taste the fruit yoghurt or blueberries
                        or green tea with ginger and lemon. Believe me. It’s tasty and healthy.</p>
