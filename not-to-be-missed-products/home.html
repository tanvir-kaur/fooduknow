                    <h3>Green Tea - a cup of good health !!! </h3>
                    <h4>April 22,2017</h4>
                    <p>
                        Green tea is a rich source of polyphenols (catechins), which acts as antioxidants in the body and helps to fight against
                        cancer. It also acts as a stimulant, just like the black tea, as it contains caffeine.
                    </p>
                    <p class="hidden-article-section" id="div-green-tea1">
                        The difference between these two these is the difference in how these are processed. Black tea undergoes a fermentation with
                        the enzyme, polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and on the other hand, green tea undergoes steaming to prevent
                        fermentation. It isn’t good to consume green tea along with the meals as it chelates iron and subsequently
                        affects its absorption in the body. Green tea increases metabolism, and would help in us in staying
                        fit and healthy by increasing the fat oxidation in the body. So next time, why not try a cup of health
                        tea (green tea).

                    <h3>Chocolate(y) Health !!!</h3>
                    <h4>April 22,2017</h4>
                    <p>
                        Generally chocolate is a high calorie food, which can lead to gain in weight gain and increased risk of diseases, if consumed
                        in excessive amount. But, chocolate can form a healthy diet if consumed in moderation.
                    </p>

                    <div class="hidden-article-section" id="div-chocolatey">
                        <p> Also, if we compare the health benefits of milk chocolate with dark chocolate, the latter one is
                            more nutritious due to a higher cocoa content. Although, dark chocolate is a bit bitter in taste
                            due to a higher cocoa content. But it is highly nutritious as being a source of antioxidants
                            in the form of flavonoids (particularly (-)epicatechin), which are act as free-radical quenchers
                            in the body and protect against cardiovascular disease and cancer.</p>
                        <p>
                            Apart of this, anti-ageing benefits are also offered by its consumption. Dark chocolate has a higher catechin (a source of
                            antioxidants) content as compared to green tea. It also raises the HDL levels, and protects LDL
                            against oxidation, as well as, is a good source of minerals, particularly magnesium.
                            </br>
                            Dark chocolate lifts the happiness quotient in a person by releasing endophorins. So go ahead and include the healthier one
                            in your diet, along with enjoying a good taste.

                    <h4>April 22,2017</h4>
                    <p>
                        The market these days is flooded with probiotic food products, which impart health benefits. Probiotics are live microorganisms
                        that can be ingested and these healthy bacteria, majorly include lactic acid bacteria, improve the
                        gut flora.
                    </p>
                    <div class="hidden-article-section" id="div-synbiotics">
                        <p> Apart from this, prebiotics, that are non-digestible fibres that promote the growth of probiotic
                            organisms. These enter the gut undigested as these are are not broken down by the digestive enzymes.
                            A combination of probiotics and prebiotics, known as synbiotics, is gaining a lot of attention
                            these days. And we can add them in our diet to gain double benefits.</p>
                        <p>
                            In a study conducted on commercial probiotic dahi, taken as the standard, in which FOS (fructooligosaccharide), and chikoo
                            (
                            <i> Manilkara zapota </i>) pulp were added to increase the shelf life of the probiotic dahi.
                            FOS being a prebiotic is a non-digestible food ingredient and is helpful for the growth of probiotic
                            bacteria. Chikoo is being used to enhance the taste and flavour of the dahi. It also provides
                            fibres which will further be helpful in the growth of probiotic bacteria. By the chemical tests
                            and microbiological enumeration, it showed that the prepared dahi (with FOS and chikoo pulp added)
                            is of superior quality with a longer shelf life. Hence, it was concluded that the addition of
                            FOS along with the fruit pulp (
                            <i>chikoo</i>) has a synbiotic effect and promotes the growth of probiotic bacteria.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Probiotic dahi with added FOS and chikoo pulp opens up opportunities for chikoo processing, which is an under-utilized fruit.
                            Also, nutrients from the fruit hitherto absent in the dahi, are a part of synbiotic dahi so prepared.

                    <h3>The Golden (Turmeric) Milk </h3>
                    <h4>April 22,2017</h4>
                    <p>
                        Turmeric is usually found in every Indian kitchen. The recipe of consuming the combination of turmeric with milk is quite
                        old, and comes to us from our grandma.
                    </p>
                    <div class="hidden-article-section" id="div-turmeric-milk">
                        <p>
                            It is known as an immunity builder and has various health benefits, still it is under-rated. Turmeric, not just has medicinal
                            potential, but is also used in cosmetics, and is considered auspicious in Hindu rituals. The
                            phytochemical present in turmeric is curcumin, which is responsible for the golden colour and
                            is known for its therapeutic potential. There are many health improving factors involved with
                            the consumption of turmeric:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Relief from cough & cold in case of respiratory disorder </li>
                            <li>Liver tonic (hepatoprotective effects), especially in case of jaundice </li>
                            <li>Blood purifier, as it bestows antioxidant activities</li>
                            <li>Anticancer property</li>
                            <li>Good sleeping aid </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Turmeric has been combating diseases from the time immemorial in every Indian home. The main advantage of using this spice
                            is that its therapeutic activity is not degraded by heat, hence can be used in cooking. So why
                            not try adding this spice to your milk the next time, instead of just artificially flavoring
                            the milk. Not just due to the color it gets by addition in milk, but also by the health effects
                            it provides, it can be aptly called a Golden Drink.
                        </p>
