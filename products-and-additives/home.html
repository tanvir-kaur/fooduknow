                        As the market value of functional food grows, role of probiotics is also become prominent, along with consideration of regulatory
                        structure appropriate to them. FAO/WHO defined the probiotics as live microorganisms which provide
                        health benefits to the host when administered in adequate amount. Probiotics could classify under
                        various categories depending upon their intended use by regulatory body of that country.

                    <p>
                        Standards of tea, the top commercial crop in India, has come under the purview of FSSAI to maintain the quality and safety
                        of it, while the tea board also regulates the trade activities of tea in India, as well as in other
                        countries. Lately, green tea has become one of the most demanding teas in India due to its health
                        benefit like antioxidant activity etc. Indian Food Authority has categorized green tea under beverage
                        category and defined it as a product that is exclusively derived from leaves, buds and tender stems
                        of varieties of the species Camellia Sinensis with the aid of processes like enzyme inactivation,
                        rolling and drying. The difference between the different tea types is that black tea is fermented,
                        and on the other hand, green tea is unfermented.

                        <p>
                            Any extraneous matter, insect, rodent, or harmful substances and colors are not allowed in green tea but it may contain natural
                            flavor or flavoring substances. Various forms of probiotic food products available in the market
                            are yogurt, fruit drinks, etc. Majorly consumed yogurt can be made even more healthy option by
                            the addition of fruit pulp to it. Probiotics are sensitive to external environmental stresses,
                            like high temperature and low pH. .Hence, these are encapsulated to increase their viability
                            in the body of the host. Food grade polymers like, CMC, gelatin, alginate are used for this purpose.

                            It is quite important to stay fit and healthy, so that we can enjoy life and eat whatever we want. One step towards this
                            would be improving the gut flora. Whenever we are on a course of antibiotics, which kill the
                            probiotics in the body, it is always recommended to consume probiotics after the course is complete,
                            to recover back the gut flora.

                        Irradiation, also known as cold pasteurization, is used for preservation of food items and hence, reduces post-harvest product
                        losses.
                        <i> Food and Agriculture organization </i>(FAO), <i>World Health Organization</i> (WHO), <i>International Atomic
                        Energy Agency </i>(IAEA) and<i> Codex Alimentarius commission</i> has approved irradiation process
                        for use in food products. Regulations are mandatory to keep a check on the safety of irradiated products
                        for consumer use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CODEX and USFDA has allowed maximum dose of radiation up to 10 kGy irrespective of food items and purpose of irradiations.
                        Approval for irradiation of food is not required up to this limit in any country. On other hand,
                        FSSAI has defined the minimum and maximum dose limit of irradiation based on class of food along
                        with its purpose.

                        High intensity sweeteners or non-nutritive sweeteners are sugar substitutes, with low calories, which are used in many food
                        and beverage products. FSSAI, USFDA and EU has allowed the use of Acesulfame potassium, Aspartame,
                        Saccharine, Neotame, and Sucralose as food additives in various food products. In the present time,
                        consumers have become quite health conscious and wish to enjoy a low calorie diet. Hence, non-nutritive
                        sweeteners could be used in various food category as per additive regulations in India.Minimum total
                        solid content in carbonated water/sweetened aerated water/fruit beverage/carbonated fruit beverage/fruit
                        nectar is not required if artificial sweeteners are used in them. These artificial sweeteners are
                        not recommended for children.
