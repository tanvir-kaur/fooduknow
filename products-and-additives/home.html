                    <h4>April 22,2017</h4>
                    <p>
                        Standards of tea, the top commercial crop in India, has come under the purview of FSSAI to maintain the quality and safety
                        of it, while the tea board also regulates the trade activities of tea in India, as well as in other
                        countries.
                    </p>

                    <div class="hidden-article-section" id="div-green-tea">
                        <p>Lately, green tea has become one of the most demanding teas in India due to its health benefit like
                            antioxidant activity etc. Indian Food Authority has categorized green tea under beverage category
                            and defined it as a product that is exclusively derived from leaves, buds and tender stems of
                            varieties of the species Camellia Sinensis with the aid of processes like enzyme inactivation,
                            rolling and drying. The difference between the different tea types is that black tea is fermented,
                            and on the other hand, green tea is unfermented.</p>
                        <p>
                            Any extraneous matter, insect, rodent, or harmful substances and colors are not allowed in green tea but it may contain natural
                            flavor or flavoring substances. Various forms of probiotic food products available in the market
                            are yogurt, fruit drinks, etc. Majorly consumed yogurt can be made even more healthy option by
                            the addition of fruit pulp to it. Probiotics are sensitive to external environmental stresses,
                            like high temperature and low pH. .Hence, these are encapsulated to increase their viability
                            in the body of the host. Food grade polymers like, CMC, gelatin, alginate are used for this purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is quite important to stay fit and healthy, so that we can enjoy life and eat whatever we want. One step towards this
                            would be improving the gut flora. Whenever we are on a course of antibiotics, which kill the
                            probiotics in the body, it is always recommended to consume probiotics after the course is complete,
                            to recover back the gut flora.
