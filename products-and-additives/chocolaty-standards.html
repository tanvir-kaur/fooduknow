                        Most of chocolates in India are imported and has vegetable fats along with cocoa butter in them and are known as “imitation
                        chocolate”; use of vegetable fats is prohibited in Indian standards, but allowed as per CODEX and
                        USFDA. Quite recently, FSSAI has issued a draft to allow vegetable fat up to 5% of finished products,
                        excluding the weight of other edible foodstuffs (like nuts), but with a minimum content of cocoa
                        material in chocolate. Additives of following functional class like artificial sweeteners, emulsifiers,
                        stabilizers, sequestering and buffering agents are allowed as per additives standards.
